# Nifty 50 Stock Price Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the closing price of the Nifty 50 stock index using historical data. Two different machine learning models, **Random Forest Regressor** and **Linear Regression**, are built and evaluated to compare their performance on this prediction task.

---

## üìä Project Overview

The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:
1.  **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** The historical stock data is loaded from an Excel file, cleaned, and prepared for analysis.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Key trends, distributions, and correlations within the data are visualized to gain insights.
3.  **Feature Selection:** Relevant features are selected to train the models.
4.  **Model Training:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and both Random Forest and Linear Regression models are trained.
5.  **Performance Evaluation:** The models are evaluated using various regression metrics to determine their accuracy and effectiveness.
6.  **Visualization of Results:** The predictions from both models are plotted against the actual prices for a clear visual comparison.

## üìà Dataset

The dataset used is historical Nifty 50 stock data contained in an Excel file.

* **Features (X):** `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Shares Traded`, `Turnover`
* **Target (y):** `Close`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow & Methodology

1.  **Data Cleaning:**
    * Loaded the dataset from an Excel file.
    * Removed leading/trailing spaces from column names.
    * Converted the `Date` column to a standard datetime format.
    * Dropped any rows with missing values and sorted the data chronologically.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Visual analysis was performed to understand data distributions, relationships, and trends. The composite plot below shows the distribution of closing prices, a boxplot to identify outliers, the strong linear relationship between open and close prices, and a heatmap of feature correlations.

3.  **Model Training & Evaluation:**
    * The data was split into an 80% training set and a 20% testing set.
    * Two models were trained on the data:
        * `RandomForestRegressor`
        * `LinearRegression`
    * The models were evaluated using the following metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R¬≤ Score, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

## üöÄ Model Performance

Both models achieved very high performance on the test data, with R¬≤ scores of 1.00 indicating an almost perfect fit. The Linear Regression model showed slightly better performance across most metrics.

| Metric                      | Random Forest Regressor | Linear Regression |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------- |
| Mean Absolute Error (MAE)   | 58.87                   | 37.79             |
| Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)| 76.82                   | 54.74             |
| R¬≤ Score                    | 1.00                    | 1.00              |
| **Model Accuracy (100-MAPE)** | **99.68%** | **99.79%** |

## üìã How to Use

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShrikarBende/Stock-Market-Prediction.git
    cd Stock-Market-Prediction
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn openpyxl
    ```

3.  **Prepare the dataset:**
    * Place the `Nifty_50.xlsx` data file in the project's root directory.
    * **Important:** In the Jupyter Notebook, update the file path in the data loading cell to avoid errors:
        ```python
        # old path (example from a specific computer)
        df = pd.read_excel("C:/Users/YourUsername/Nifty_50.xlsx")
        
        # update to a relative path:
        df = pd.read_excel("Nifty_50.xlsx")
        ```

4.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    * Open and run the `Stock_Price_Prediction_Model_DS_CP.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment.
